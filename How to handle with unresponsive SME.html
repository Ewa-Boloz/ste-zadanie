<h1>How to handle an unresponsive SME's</h1>.
<p>Here you can find my tips for handling with difficult, unresponsive SME’s:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Get a few topics together for discussion, then propose a meeting.</li>
    <li>Don't ask when they’re available. Check their calendar, send an invitation to the meeting and ask if the time and place suits them. Reassure you that you will adapt if they need to reschedule the meeting.</li>
    <li>Add an agenda to the meeting outline - it will help to estimate how much time your meeting will take.</li>
    <li>Be prepared - research background information about the topic, ask only if you couldn’t find any information.</li>
    <li>Don’t be late, keep to the time limit and make notes!</li>
    <li>Some people do not like to be interviewed - check if SME prefer meeting or maybe email communication. If they prefer to be emailed gather all questions in topics and send them full list of questions at once (with deadline date).</li>
    <li>Send reminder email - they could forget about you at all, so…</li>
    <li>…try to be memorized and help them with their tasks.</li>
</ul>
